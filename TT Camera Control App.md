# Technical Task
For the development of 
- the iOS mobile device application (app), providing the full control over the __R7 PRIMUS__ camera (_client part_), and 
- the corresponding _server part_ on a PC with video streaming capacity.

### Requirements to the code
- __client OS__: iOS
- __server OS__: target - Windows (or Ubuntu) (but the code itself should be preferably cross-platform)
- __CMake__: in order to make the solution more cross-platform friendly
- __IDE__: Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 / XCode
- __C++__: C++11
- __types.h__: All platform-specific definition must be declared here
- __C++ style__: Preferably use [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- __Documentation__: Doxygen

## Client Part (iOS app)
The App should provide communication with the server part and be capable to: 
- esteblish client-server connection;
- get and visualize information about the camera status; 
- send the control commands. 
- retrieve and show the "live view"; 
- retrieve and show the recorded footage; 

Both live view and recorded footage should be visualized in one the three modes (selected by a user):
1. __Single Camera__: view from a single camera
2. __Panoramic__: 360° surround panoramic view
3. __3d Glasses__: 360° monoscopic surround panoramic view (for the left and right eyes), seen for example with the [Google Cardbox] (https://vr.google.com/cardboard/)

All the visualized data must be present within a user-friendly graphical interface. Consider the DJI GO app as a vivid example. 

### Information about the camera status- online / offline
- number of functioning cameras (with serial numbers)
- camera geometry (with orientation in respect to the _main_ camera)
- server HDD remaining capacity (in number of shots and in minuets/seconds of video)
- [exposure value (EV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_value)
- ISO (gain)
- shutter speed
- time of the currently recorded video

### Live View and Records Preview
- show the image from selected camera
- show the stitched panorama image from all the cameras
- rewind / pause the recorded footage

### Control commands
- photo / video mode switching
- interval shooting mode
- automatic / manual exposure switching
- delete recorded footage
- start / stop shooting
- raw8 / raw12 / raw16 mode switching
- set saturation
- set sharpness
- set shutter speed
- set contrast
- set ISO (gain)
- set EV
- Switch resolution

## Server Part (PC-based application)
The server software will be integrated into the [Video Capturing and Camera Controlling] (https://github.com/Reality7/R7-Surround360/edit/master/source/camera_ctrl) framework and be capable to: 
- esteblish client-server connection;
- provide information about the camera status; 
- stream the "live view" to the client; 
- get and stream the recorded footage to the client; 
- recieve and process the control commands from client and forward it further to the camera controller; 

### Communication Protocol
In order to provide the exchange of information, _i.e._ camera ststaus information from server to client, and camera control commands from client to server a network protocol, built upon TCP / IP should be developed and specified. (The Control Message Protocl (CMP) may be utilized for this purpose). Using the protocol, the server part must provide control of the entire camera parameters and process the queries of the connected client App (see the list of basic enquires above in the Client Part)

### Video Streaming
The streaming module (based for example on [Live555](http://www.live555.com/), __ffmpeg__ or analogue) should be integrated into the server part. It should support RTSP protocol and provide the video streaming service. It should be able to stream the following kinds of sequences:
1. Sequence from a single camera (square size) 
2. 360° panoramic view (with different resolutions) (width to height: 2:1)
3. a part of 360° panoramic view (filling the whole device screen). The part of the 360° panoramic view is streamed when the user enters the "3d glasses" mode.

  
## Milestones
### Phase I
1. Create the Skeleton of the App for iOS (iPad / iPhone) with start / stop button (for starting and stopping recording). 
   Develop the design of the App, including the color design and look in Corporate Identitiy. Apply this design. (32 hours)
2. Create the Skeleton of the Server part. Implement the start / stop functionality with the underlying communication protocol between      server and client and be able to test this functionality. (24 hours)
3. Implement the control of the __white balance__, __shutter speed__ and __FPS__ on both client and server sides. Test it. (??? hours)
4. Implement the live video streaming functionality on the server side. (??? hours)
5. Implement the live video viewing functionality on the client side. Test it with the server part. (??? hours)
6. Implement the switching between view from a single camera (by index of the camera) and 360° view (these views have different resolution) (??? hours)
7. Show the camera status (??? hours)
8. Implement the remaining control commands (??? hours)
9. Document the code (??? hours)
10. Testing and debugging (??? hours)

??? - hours estimations to be filled by the Freelancer

The source code for each milestone should be submitted to repository and tested / checked by the R7 team.

### Phase II
1. Implement the recorded video streaming functionality on the server side. (??? hours)
       - discuss the serialized video format
       - discuss the video unpacking from the raw format
2. Implement the recorded video viewing functionality on the client side. Test it with the server part. (??? hours)
3. Implement the rewinding and pausing functionality. (??? hours)
4. Implement the cutting-out and deleting functionality (??? hours)
5. Document the code. (??? hours)
6. Testing and debugging. (??? hours)
